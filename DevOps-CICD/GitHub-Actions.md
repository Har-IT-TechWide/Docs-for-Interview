### **GitHub Actions Interview Questions with Explanations and Examples**  

GitHub Actions is a powerful **CI/CD tool** that automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications. Below is a list of **common interview questions** along with **detailed explanations and examples**.

---

## **1. What is GitHub Actions? How does it work?**  
### **Explanation:**  
GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD automation tool** that enables users to automate workflows within their GitHub repositories. It allows developers to create **custom workflows** for building, testing, and deploying applications based on triggers such as push, pull request, or scheduled events.  

### **Example Scenario:**  
A developer wants to run tests automatically when code is pushed to the repository. A simple workflow might look like this:  

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

## **2. What are the key components of GitHub Actions?**  
### **Explanation:**  
GitHub Actions consists of several key components:  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Workflows** | Define automated processes and reside in `.github/workflows/`. |
| **Events** | Trigger workflows (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`). |
| **Jobs** | A set of steps that execute on a runner. |
| **Steps** | Individual tasks in a job (e.g., checking out code, running a script). |
| **Actions** | Pre-built reusable components (e.g., `actions/checkout`). |
| **Runners** | Machines that execute workflows (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, etc.). |

### **Example Scenario:**  
A developer wants to create a workflow triggered by a `push` event that runs on **Ubuntu** and executes a script.  

```yaml
name: Example Workflow
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run a script
        run: echo "Hello GitHub Actions!"
```

## **3. How do you create and trigger a GitHub Actions workflow?**  
### **Explanation:**  
1. **Create a workflow file** inside `.github/workflows/` (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`).  
2. **Define events** to trigger the workflow (`push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`).  
3. **Define jobs and steps** to run within the workflow.  
4. **Commit and push** the file to trigger the workflow.  

### **Example Scenario:**  
A workflow that triggers on a **push** to the `main` branch:  

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy Application
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

---

## **4. What are reusable workflows in GitHub Actions?**  
### **Explanation:**  
Reusable workflows allow multiple repositories or workflows to **reuse common logic** instead of duplicating code. They help maintain **consistency and modularity**.  

### **Example Scenario:**  
A **reusable workflow** for testing applications (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):  

```yaml
name: Reusable Test Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node_version:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node_version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

Now, any repository can call this workflow like this:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-reusable:
    uses: my-org/my-repo/.github/workflows/test.yml@main
    with:
      node_version: '18'
```

## **5. What are composite actions in GitHub Actions?**  
### **Explanation:**  
A **composite action** is a reusable GitHub Action that contains **multiple steps** within a single action, allowing code reusability across workflows.  

### **Example Scenario:**  
A composite action stored in `.github/actions/my-action/action.yml`:  

```yaml
name: My Composite Action
description: A reusable composite action for setting up Node.js

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      shell: bash
```

Usage in a workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use My Composite Action
        uses: ./.github/actions/my-action
```

## **6. How do you manage secrets in GitHub Actions?**  
### **Explanation:**  
- GitHub provides **encrypted secrets** for securely storing sensitive data.  
- Secrets are accessed using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` inside workflows.  

### **Example Scenario:**  
Setting up **secrets** (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in a deployment workflow:  

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: aws s3 sync ./app s3://my-bucket
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

---

## **7. How do you trigger workflows manually in GitHub Actions?**  
### **Explanation:**  
GitHub Actions supports **manual triggers** using the `workflow_dispatch` event.  

### **Example Scenario:**  
A workflow that allows developers to **trigger it manually**:  

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Target environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying to ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}"
```

## **8. What are best practices for GitHub Actions?**  
### **Explanation:**  
1. **Use reusable workflows** for modularity.  
2. **Leverage caching** to speed up builds.  
3. **Use environment secrets** for sensitive data.  
4. **Limit permissions** to reduce security risks.  
5. **Use matrix builds** to test across multiple environments.  
6. **Use self-hosted runners** for better control.
